## Welcome to my test website!

I'm a new user to the world of web development. Let's learn stuff!

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/QuantuMatrix/JDJR/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the ~~content for your website in Markdown files.~~

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
